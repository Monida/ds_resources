# Data Science Resources

This repository contains a compendium of resources that have helped me throughout the years to learn about the different aspects of Data Science.

1. Programming 
2. Machine Learning
3. Bioinformatics
4. Data Engineering 
   
Most of the resources are open access but if they are not, I specify it. 

These are resources I find myself going back to over and over again when I need to learn or remember some concepts. 

I like them because they help you to truly understand what's going, and they always go to the point.

I hope these resources help you as much as they have helped me.
