# Here you can find resources that have been very helpful to learn Machine Learning

## Long courses

1. [Introduction to Statistical Learning](https://www.statlearning.com/)

A book by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani, that gives a good introduction about the statistics you need to learn Machine Learning. The book comes in the R and Python edition. **It is not open source** but it is a good investment to get started with Machine Learning and to have as a reference.

2.[Linear Algebra](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/) by Prof. Gilbert Strang

Open course from MIT. The best course in linear Algebra, you can ask anyone who has taken this course and they will agree!

3. [Machine Learning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdxMplOfP1w&list=PL2qEL_7r0QISbIq8G5ywDv8go0EVr5bky&ab_channel=Everythingtech%26AI) by Andrew Ng
